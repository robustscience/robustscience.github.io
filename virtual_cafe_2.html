            <strong>Question 2:</strong> What roadmap (future principles/practices/tools/systems) can better bring about
            improvements to the scalability, trust, and reproducibility of results for high-throughput applications?
            What recommendations can enhance the ability of future software and hardware systems to meet this roadmap on
            next generation systems?

            Provide us with use cases (and other examples) to support the discussion during this Virtual Caf√©. Use cases
            can include software and hardware systems that have (fully or partially) addressed scalability,
            trustworthiness, and reproducibility issues or software and hardware systems that are in need of solutions
            for scalability, trustworthiness, and reproducibility.
