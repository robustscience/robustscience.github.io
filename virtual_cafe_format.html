        We understand that lengthy remote sessions can be taxing, that is why we are designing our workshops to be
        engaging for everyone. It is our goal to create a dynamic environment where each person can contribute to the
        discussion with ease and simplicity. Each workshop is being developed to address important questions in a format
        that is cohesive, constructive and creative.

        There are three main technological features being implemented for these workshops:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>ZOOM Meetings:</strong> Each workshop will be held remotely with a team of facilitators and it will
            be recorded. The workshop will include whole group discussions and small breakout sessions led by a PI
            facilitator. These smaller groups are generally better suited for a higher-level of engagement between
            participants.
        </li>

        <li><strong><a href="https://www.mural.co/" target="_blank">MURAL</a>:</strong> During the workshop, both
            facilitators and workshop participants will use this application during the small group breakout sessions.
            It is a collaborative online tool that provides a visual interface to a virtual environment. Even if you
            have never used MURAL, we will provide you with the basic tools you’ll need in advance with a template that
            is easy to configure. Plus, our project members will be well-versed in this application to assist you. Even
            after the workshop has ended, you will also be able to contribute to the Mural in case you forgot to add
            something. All the groups will share one Mural, enabling us to focus on the feedback individually and within
            the broader context.
        </li>

        <li><strong>SURVEYS:</strong> Our assessment team will email surveys to participants following our workshops. We
            intend to create surveys to concisely focus on the project objectives and get your feedback on the overall
            format. These surveys serve a crucial component for the project outcomes.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <strong>TIMELINE FOR PARTICIPANTS:</strong> About a week prior to the scheduled workshop, details will be
        emailed to you including information on accessing the workshop, an agenda and pre-workshop materials to help you
        prepare for an informed discussion. We will also upload the agenda and materials to the website once they become
        available.
