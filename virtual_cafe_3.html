            implement best curriculum and training practices tailored for robust science for high throughput
            applications? Do we need changes of the curriculum/training practice or just changes in the way the current
            curriculum is taught / the training practices are used? What additional/complementary curriculum / training
            material is it needed?

            <strong>Future Roadmap:</strong> How can we remove silos among communities (e.g., between CS and other
            sciences) and foster collaborations targeting workforce development and robust science? Who is in charge of
            implementing/distributing/sharing/making curriculum and training broadly available?
