                <strong>Current State of the Practice:</strong> What is already available and what is still needed to
                implement best curriculum and training practices tailored for robust science for high throughput
                applications? Do we need changes of the curriculum/training practice or just changes in the way the
                current curriculum is taught / the training practices are used? What additional/complementary
                curriculum/training material is it needed?

                <strong>Future Roadmap:</strong> How can we remove silos among communities (e.g., between CS and other
                sciences) and foster collaborations targeting workforce development and robust science? Who is in charge
                of implementing/distributing/sharing/making curriculum and training broadly available?
