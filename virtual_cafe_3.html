            <strong>Question 1:</strong> What is already available and what is still needed to implement best curriculum
            and training practices tailored for robust science for high throughput applications? Do we need changes of
            the curriculum/training practice contents or just changes in the way the current curriculum is taught / the
            training practices are used? What additional/complementary curriculum / training material is it needed?

        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <strong>Question 2:</strong> How can we remove silos among communities (e.g., between CS and other sciences)
            and foster collaborations targeting workforce development and robust science? Who is in charge of
            implementing/distributing/sharing/making curriculum and training broadly available?

            Provide us with use cases (and other examples) to support the discussion during this Virtual Café. Use cases
            can include curriculum material and training practices that have (fully or partially) addressed scalability,
            trustworthiness, and reproducibility issues or curriculum material and training practices that are in need
            of solutions for scalability, trustworthiness, and reproducibility.
