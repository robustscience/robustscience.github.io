            <p><strong>One virtual platform: Virtual Cafés supported by Mural</strong></p>
            <p>
                A Virtual World Café is an online event that fosters knowledge sharing and creates opportunities for
                actions. Café participants are distributed across several breakout sessions, with participants switching
                sessions periodically and getting introduced to the previous discussion at their new session by a
                session lead.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://mural.co" target="_blank">Mural</a> is a browser-based interface supporting virtual
                discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Virtual World Cafés will engage both the science and engineering communities to share knowledge and
                define new collaboration opportunities through structured discussions hosted on Mural.
